# sapthesisdown

This project was inspired by the [thesisdown](https://github.com/ismayc/thesisdown) package and is a Rmarkdown adaptation of the LaTeX template [sapthesis](http://biccari.altervista.org/c/informatica/latex/sapthesis.php).

Currently, the PDF and gitbook versions are fully-functional.  The word and epub versions are developmental, have no templates behind them, and are essentially calls to the appropriate functions in bookdown.
